        <font face="arial" size="10">M</font>uhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu pronunciation: [moɦəmməd əli dʒInnaɦ], Gujarati
        pronunciation: [moɦəməd ali dzIna]; born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 &ndash; 11 September 1948) was
        a barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League
        from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first
        governor-general until his death. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
        Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
        national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian
        National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career,
        Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the
        All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India
        Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of
        Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow
        a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
            1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the
            possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu&ndash;
        Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate
        nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the Muslim League gained strength while leaders of the
        Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
        reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula
        that would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading
        all parties to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state
        of Pakistan.</p>
        <p>As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies,
            and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India after the partition in
            August 1947, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died a year after Pakistan's
        creation and was buried at Mazar-e-Quaid. He is revered in Pakistan as the Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation")
        and Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.</p>
